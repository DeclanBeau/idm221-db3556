# Declan Beauchamp – Portfolio Website  
## About Me  
 I am a second year User Experience and Interaction Design major at Drexel University. However, most of the work on this website is currently mostly composed of 3D work, since I was an Animation/VFX Major during my first year at Drexel. Some of my 3D work is from my time as an Animation major from Drexel, but a lot of it is from passion projects I did when I was still in high school. Some themes I really enjoy exploring are nature and the stillness that can be captured from that, and urbanism, with all of its chaos. I really enjoy trying to find ways to blend the two, as the relationship and interactions between nature and man-made objects has always intrigued me. The other works on this site come from my time doing mixed media design in my freshman design classes, Design I for Media, and Design II for Media. During these classes, I wanted my identity as a designer to be apparent, even if I was restricted by the requirements of these classes, and I believe my identity as a designer can be seen throughout the works.

# 3D
**Forest Scene: *Made with Blender 3D, Rendered in the Cycles Engine***  
	For this scene, I wanted to capture a magical sort of feeling, with the light coming from the sky through the fog. To do this,  I took advantage of the volumetrics in Blender, which is something that the Cycles engine does well. I think that because of the volumetrics in this scene, I could capture that magical sense I was going for in the piece.  
**300SL Scene: *Made with Blender, Rendered in Cycles – Car Model from Blendswap***  
	I was inspired by the way city lights look like on a rainy night for this piece. Cities become more colorful on a rainy night because all of the lights cut through and reflect off of the rain and the puddles. It creates a calm, colorful atmosphere, which was a lot of fun to recreate in Blender.  
**Stairway Video: *Made with Blender, Rendered in Cycles, composited in Blender***  
	For this video, I wanted to blend nature and man-made elements together in a sort of dream-like way, seen with the grass growing indoors, and the strange light at the top. This sort of dream-like familiarity has always been an interesting concept to me, and it is something I try to capture frequently.    
**Record Video: *Made with Blender, Rendered in Cycles, composited in DaVinci Resolve***  
	For this video, I wanted to learn some more skills in a stylish way. Records are difficult to model in 3D up close because of all the grooves in them, and I wanted to challenge myself to model and animate one in a realistic way.  
**Inflatable Physics Test: *Made with Blender, Rendered in Cycles, composited in Blender***  
	This was another skill exercise that I wanted to do in a fun way. I did this by using the internal physics engine in Blender, with a non-collapsing cloth simulation, and a wind force. By doing this, I could create one of the inflatable men that car dealerships use.  
**Design I Final: *Made with Blender, Rendered in Eevee***  
	This was the final project for my Design I class. I had the constraints of black and white, and it could only be a minute long. I wanted to tell the story of the relationship between humans and nature, with the city being built out of the forest.  
**Kitchen Scene: *Models done in Maya, Textures done in Substance Painter, Rendered in Redshift – Model and Texture credit to Xing Lin, Thien Binh Vo, and Ethan Richards***  
	This was the first group project I had done in 3D, and my group decided to do an industrial kitchen scene. We modeled, textured, and rendered our specific models and then made our own compositions out of our model library.  
**Record Player Model: *Modeled in Maya, Rendered in ARNOLD***  
	This was the final project for my Computer Graphics Imagery I final. The assignment was to model an object that you had in your home, and I decided to model a record player that I have. The biggest challenge was getting the pattern on the side correct, but otherwise, I think it was a good model for the first thing I modeled in Maya.   
**Pinball Video: *Modeled in Maya, Rendered in ARNOLD***  
    This was an assignment for my Animation I class, and the assignment was to create a 10 second perfect loop.   
**Design I for Media Project 0: *Adobe Illustrator***
