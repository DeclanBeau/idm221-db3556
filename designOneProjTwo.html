            In this project, we were tasked with creating a pen and ink value scale with a pattern, and also one with images. After we did that, we had to take a photograph of ourselves as a recreation of a shot from an assigned movie, with mine being Sally Potter's <i> The Party.</i> After that, we had to posterize the image we took of ourselves, and overlay the value scales we created. Personally, I am really proud of the pen and ink one, I think the image came out super clear, and the value was translated sucessfully.
